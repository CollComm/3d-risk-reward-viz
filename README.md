# 3D Risk-Reward Visualization

A client-side web application for visualizing and exploring business opportunities as 3D scatter plots based on their risk, reward, and complexity profiles. This open-source project provides a simple and intuitive way to visualize and analyze multi-dimensional business data to aid in decision-making.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for inputting and managing business opportunity data points
- Dynamic 3D scatter plot visualization powered by Plotly.js
- Ability to add multiple data points to the same plot
- Customizable plot options (colors, labels, axes, etc.)
- Real-time updates as data points are added
- Interactive plot controls for rotating, zooming, and panning the 3D view
- Compatibility with modern web browsers

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/CollComm/3d-risk-reward-viz.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser

## Usage

1. Enter the risk value in the format "x% of losing $y" (e.g., "10% of losing $1000")
2. Enter the reward value in the format "x% of winning $y" (e.g., "80% of winning $1000")
3. Enter the complexity value in the format "x man hour" or "x man hours" (e.g., "100 man hour")
4. Click the "Generate Plot" button to add the data point to the 3D scatter plot
5. Repeat steps 1-4 to add more data points to the same plot
